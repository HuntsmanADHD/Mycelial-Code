  THEN: Write ARM64 code generation strategy (4.1)

SONNET:
  NOW: Design IR specification incorporating x86-64 patterns
       → /docs/architecture/ir-specification.md (3.1)
  WHEN OPUS KB DOCS DONE: Incorporate instruction selection patterns, finalize

HAIKU:
  NOW: Monitor progress, prepare to review documents as they complete
  THEN: Review KB docs for quality (5.1)
  THEN: Review ARM64 strategy (4.3)
  THEN: Coordinate final team alignment (5.2)

================================================================================
WHAT'S THE NEXT CHECKPOINT?
================================================================================

OPUS:  Complete checkpoint 2.1.5 (x86-64 instructions KB complete)
       Then move to 2.2.1 (System V ABI KB)
       See: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md lines 133-160

SONNET: Complete checkpoint 3.1.11 (IR spec with all examples)
        Then wait for Opus KB docs before finalizing
        See: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md lines 187-217

HAIKU: Checkpoint 5.1.1 (Review KB docs as they arrive)
       See: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md lines 319-328

================================================================================
IF YOU'RE JUMPING IN MID-STREAM
================================================================================

SITUATION 1: You're Opus, resuming where you left off
  → Open PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, find "### 2.1 - x86-64 Instruction Reference"
  → You're at checkpoint 2.1.1 or beyond
  → Follow checklist through 2.1.5
  → When complete, move to 2.2.1
  → Reference x86-64-codegen.md for content to extract

SITUATION 2: You're Sonnet, resuming where you left off
  → Open PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, find "### 3.1 - IR Specification"
  → You're at checkpoint 3.1.x
  → Continue designing IR per specification
  → When Opus finishes KB docs, incorporate instruction patterns
  → See SONNET_IR_BRIEFING.md for full context

SITUATION 3: You're Haiku, resuming where you left off
  → Open PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, find "### 5.1 - Knowledge Base Quality Review"
  → Wait for Opus KB docs, then begin 5.1.1
  → Review each doc using criteria in OPERATIONS.md
  → Flag issues, coordinate resolution
  → Prepare team alignment (5.2)

SITUATION 4: You don't know who you are
  → Read COMPILER_TEAM_MANIFEST.json to see your role
  → Read PROGRESS_TRACKER.md to understand the full picture
  → Find your section in the "WHAT'S EACH PERSON DOING" section above

================================================================================
CONTACT & ESCALATION
================================================================================

If blocked:
  1. Check PROGRESS_TRACKER.md for clarification
  2. Check OPERATIONS.md for quality criteria
  3. Check specific briefing document (SONNET_IR_BRIEFING.md, etc.)
  4. Ask Haiku for coordination help

If confused about what's next:
  1. Find your checkpoint in PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
  2. Read the next numbered item (e.g., if at 2.1.3, read 2.1.4)
  3. That's what to do next

If you see something blocking other people:
  → Tell Haiku immediately (flag at current checkpoint)

================================================================================
SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
================================================================================

By end of Week 3:
  ✅ All 3 x86-64 KB docs extracted and reviewed
  ✅ IR spec complete and validated against x86-64
  ✅ ARM64 strategy complete and consistent with x86-64
  ✅ All documents reviewed for quality
  ✅ Team aligned on all design decisions
  ✅ No blockers between team members
  ✅ Ready to write agents in mycelial-compiler.mycelial (M1)

When it's perfect:
  - Someone can pick up the docs and implement immediately
  - All pieces fit together without friction
  - Architecture is clear, implementable, beautiful
